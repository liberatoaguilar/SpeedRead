# SPEEDREAD

SpeedRead is an Application for MacOS 10.15+ that allows the user to read faster and more efficiently at 400 WPM or faster. SpeedRead is based on a method of speed reading called Rapid Serial Visual Perception. This consists of the screen flashing many words quickly and highlighting a key character for enhanced reading. SpeedRead becomes fullscreen to reduce distractions and help you focus on your reading.

## USAGE

Using SpeedRead is very simple:

1. Open the SpeedRead App. You will now see the SpeedRead icon on your menu bar.

2. Copy any text from a website, article, e-book, etc. and press the book icon located on your Mac’s menu bar on the top of your screen.

3. Sit back, relax, and press play to start reading. Pause at any time or press restart (top right) when finished to read again.

## SETTINGS

SpeedRead’s settings currently consist of the option to choose either a light or dark theme and change the WPM speed to your liking.

## SPECIAL NOTES

The power button (top right) quits the application completly.

SpeedRead is not meant to be used on documents that require complete focus to understand, but it is meant to be used for e-mails, or web articles to make free up the time it takes to read them.

The name SpeedRead is subject to change.
